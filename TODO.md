## TODO

- Bufferline
  - remove bufferline, try using telescope/neotree instead
  - it's unintuitive when spliting window there only 1 bufferline
  - will remove clutter
  - try find better way to navigate buffers
  - arrange buffers like harpoon

- Session
  - dashboard.nvim forced to use session, change dashboard plugin
  - probably change to auto-session
  - show recent file/session in dashboard

- Declutter
  - change statusline, only show useful stuff



- better code action, look at awesome-neovim#lsp
- typescript lsp keybinds

## Done

- buffer cycler (preview buffers)
- telescope show preview even when window is small
  - preview shown on top
- customize buffer line to show minimal info
  since details will be shown on cybu

- (not possible) modify/arrange bufferline in a buffer (like harpoon)

- telescope cd on find files

- neotree search functions
  - how to jump to parent
  - how to select on "/" mode
