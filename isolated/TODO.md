# Before can edit in isolated:
- [ ] lsp on attaches
- [ ] nvim-cmp
- [ ] telescope
- [ ] treesitter

# TODO:
- [ ] add autocommand to do lsp stuff when moving/renaming files using neo-tree
- [ ] Cherry pick commits with prefix '[nvim]' to main branch
- [ ] Move this isolated dir to new repo so that it doesn't interfere with main nvim config while migrating
